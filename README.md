# Welcome!

Thank you for taking part in this practical interview test.

Your objective will be to complete the tasks as quickly and efficiently as you can.

You are encouraged to leave comments to explain your thinking process where necessary.
If there is anything that is unclear and stops you completing the task, please leave a comment.

**Caveat:** You __cannot__ edit the contents on the `index.html` file.

Reason for this is, a lot of the work we do involves injecting code onto other
website that we do not have control over. This is to simulate that behaviour.

**Note:** You may write your code in ES6+ format, as the test will be reviewed in Chrome.

## Tasks - found inside public/script.js

1. Create a function to sort valid slot sizes
2. Insert a div id into the correct placement
3. Inject Googletag (advert) code to see an advert
4. Amend slot sizes with the function you previously created

**Optional Task:**
5. Inside `script.test.js`, create a function to make pass the Jest tests.

## Sending back the results

Please zip your finished test files and send them back via email.
Please **DO NOT** fork and upload your results to github.

We appreciate your time for taking this test.

Many Thanks,
Publisher Collective Team
