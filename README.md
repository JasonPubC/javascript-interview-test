# Welcome!

Thank you for taking part in this practical interview test.

Your objective will be to complete the tasks as quickly and efficiently as you can.\
This test should take roughly **1 hour** to complete.

You are encouraged to leave comments to explain your thinking process where necessary.\
If there is anything that is unclear and stops you completing the task, please leave a comment.

**Caveat:** You ***cannot*** edit the contents on the `index.html` file.

Reason: A lot of the work we do involves clients websites that we have no control over,\
so injecting code onto their website is what we do 99% of the time.\
This is to simulate that restriction.

**Note:** You may write your code in ES6+ format, as the test will be reviewed in Chrome.

## Tasks - found inside `public/script.js`

1. Create a function to sort valid slot sizes
2. Insert a div with an id `nn_mpu1` into the correct placement
3. Inject Googletag (advert) code to see an advert
4. Amend slot sizes with the function you created earlier

**Optional Task:**\
5. Inside `script.test.js`, create a function to make pass the Jest tests.

## Sending back the results

Please zip your finished test files and send them back via email.\
Please **DO NOT** fork and upload your results to github. If you can make it\
a "private" repo, add me (JasonPubC) as a collaborator.

We appreciate your time for taking this test.

Many Thanks,\
Publisher Collective Team
